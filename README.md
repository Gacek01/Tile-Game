# Tile-Game
Simple game of finding matching pictures put together using Javascript.
I created this simple project mostly to practice JavaScript and manipulating DOM.
Pictures are all taken from the FontAwesome specific icons. These can be amended in icons[].
Game is based on a matrix of even cells and played having 2, 4 or 6 items in a row.
This can be adjusted in const SIZE, having bigger grid is not possible as the number of pictures coveres only 6x6 grid and the game what would be too dificult.
